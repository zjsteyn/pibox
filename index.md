## Quick Start Instructions

1. Download the RaspberryPi .img [file](https://github.com/drassil/git-wiki) - It's a large download ~8GB

2. Download either the Windows / Mac OS / Linux version of [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) - You will use this to write the .img file to an SD card to get your Raspberry Pi setup up and running.

3. Follow the 1-2-3 process as displayed on the [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) website.

4. Once your image has been written to the SD card you can pop it into your Raspberry Pi Model 3 B and you should be ready to go.

**Note:**

This image should work on other Raspberry Pi Setups, however Wifi hotspot setup should be configured to each invividual system.
A detailed list of all changes, including password for the setup, that was made to the original Raspbian Jessy installation can be found here: *ENTER HERE*
